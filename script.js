Now that the arguments fed into the function are all in an array we can use the every method to loop through each argument in the array to see if each argument is a valid number. The way we see if each argument is a valid number is using the Number.isFinite method. If all the numbers are valid it will return true. If any number is not a valid number it will return false.
