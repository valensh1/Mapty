The function accepts any number of arguments represented by the rest pattern with the 3 periods (...inputs) and rest pattern also converts these unlimited amount of arguments into an array. Now that the arguments fed into the function are all in an array we can use the every method to loop through each argument in the array to see if each argument is a valid number. The way we see if each argument is a valid number is using the Number.isFinite method. If all the numbers are valid it will return true. If any number is not a valid number it will return false.
        const allPositive = (...nums) => nums.every(el => el > 0); // Creation of allPositive function that takes any number of arguments and turns them into an array by using the rest parameters (...nums). Then we loop through the array and for every number we check to see if the number is greater than 0. If every number is greater than 0 it the function will return true and if not it will return false.
